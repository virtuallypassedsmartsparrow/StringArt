# StringArt

This project converts images into string art by arranging nails in a pattern on a canvas and guiding a single thread to create the artwork. The project includes four scripts, each designed to process images with different canvas shapes and color formats:

- **Black & White with Circular Canvas**
- **Black & White with Rectangular Canvas**
- **Color with Circular Canvas**
- **Color with Rectangular Canvas**

## How It Works

The code generates a `.txt` file that contains a list of nails the string should go around in a specific order. The order of the nails defines the pattern of the string art.

## Files

- `Circular_String_Art_BlackWhite_Nail_List.m`: Converts an image into a black & white String Artwork on a circular canvas.
- `Circular_String_Art_Color_Nail_List.m`: Converts an image into a black & white String Artwork on a rectangular canvas.
- `Rectangular_String_Art_BW_Nail_List.m`: Converts an image into a colored String Artwork on a circular canvas.
- `Rectangular_String_Art_Color_Nail_List.m`: Converts an image into a colored String Artwork on a rectngular canvas.
